# OS install guide

A complete overhauling documentation for OS reinstall, both Linux and Windows, from re-partitioning to setting up software.

## Useful tips

1. You can label disks and address them by `/dev/disk/by-label/mylabel` instead of `/dev/nvmeXxX`:

- `btrfs filesystem label /dev/disk label`
- `fatlabel /dev/disk LABEL` (fat32 requires uppercase)
- `cryptsetup config /dev/disk --label label`
- `e2label /dev/mapper/disk label`

## Partitioning

My main PC has 3 drives: main, secondary, data.

### main

- /main/1 - EFI, 1G
- /main/2 - Linux root, 200G, / (encrypted)
- /main/3 - Linux data, 500G, /mnt/data (encrypted)
- /main/4-5-6 - Microsoft System (reserved, system, recovery), 500G, system for gaming (encrypted)

### secondary

- /secondary/1-2-3 - Microsoft System (reserved, system, recovery), 400G, system for work (encrypted)
- /secondary/4 - Windows Data (projects) for pet projects, NTFS, 100G (encrypted)
- /secondary/5 - NTFS, Gaming (NOT encrypted)

### data

- /data/1 - Linux backup, 500G, /mnt/backup (encrypted)
- /data/2 - Linux NDA, 100G, encrypted (for sensitive project files)
- /data/3 - Windows NDA, 100G, encrypted (for sensitive project files)
- /data/4 - Shared NTFS Media/Games volume, 2T

## Bootloader

> EFI/BOOT folder can be removed - this is extra fallback option generated by systemd-boot.

- `Linux/arch-linux.efi` - Arch Linux
- `GamingMicrosoft` - Gaming Windows
- `WorkMicrosoft` - Work Windows

> Both Windows were installed in a row, to the same EFI, and then EFI folder was copied and extra entries deleted from Windows so we can load specific Windows.

## Creating partitions

```
fdisk /dev/1
g # Create new GPT partition table, generates UUID.
```

> By default uses 512b blocks, internally might be using 4k, and modern HDDs use 4k, but not worth it for SSD.

### Creating EFI partition

- EFI - 1Gb, FAT32, t1
- `mkfs.fat -F32 # dosfstools package`

### Creating linux encrypted partition

```
/dev/2
n, +200G # leave type default - Linux Filesystem
cryptsetup luksFormat /dev/2
# use secure password for PC (less secure) and EMPTY password for laptop (max security, only recovery key will work)
systemd-cryptenroll /dev/2 --recovery-key # save this securely
# Guide says using pcrs=7+15:sha0000 but that's the same as omitting 15, and without sha0000 it breaks boot
systemd-cryptenroll /dev/2 --wipe-slot=empty --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=7 # --tpm2-with-pin=yes
cryptsetup open /dev/2 root
mkfs.btrfs /dev/mapper/root
mount /dev/mapper/root /mnt # When needed for the installation
# Or:
cryptsetup close root
```

### Creating NTFS shared partition

- `mkfs.ntfs -f -L media drive` - fast format, label media

### Creating system partition for windows

Just leave empty unallocated space of fixed size before the next partition, and use it when installing Windows. It will create all necessary partitions.

## Mounting

- `/dev/2` as `/dev/mapper/root` as `/` - root
- `/dev/3` as `/dev/mapper/data` as `/mnt/data` - data
- `/dev/1` as `/efi` - EFI, as ROOT READONLY
  - `mount -o umask=0077,uid=0,gid=0` or include to fstab `umask=0077,uid=0,gid=0` instead of `fmask/dmask`
- `/dev/data/1` as `/dev/mapper/backup` as `/mnt/backup` - Backup drive from the 990 (other) drive, also encrypted
- `/dev/data/2` as `/dev/mapper/nda` as `/mnt/nda` - work partition, NOT auto-mounted
- `/dev/data/4` as `/mnt/media` - 2Tb unencrypted partition, storing media server and games, shared between OS.

> `/boot` partition is part of encrypted root, just storing temporary files for generating UKIs. UKI is then placed into EFI.

## Additional actions for UKI / encryption

This can be done during install (before all mkinitcpio hooks), but we are doing it at the end for now.

### Generate UKI

- edit /etc/mkinitcpio.conf, add sd-encrypt before filesystems hook
- edit /etc/mkinitcpio.d/linux.preset, comment `default_image`, uncomment `default_uki`
- add /etc/kernel/cmdline, otherwise it will use host system wrong params
  - `rd.luks.name=<UUID>=root root=/dev/mapper/root rw`
- mkdir -p /efi/EFI/Linux
- mkinitcpio -P

### Sign UKI

- pacman -S sbctl (include in packages in future)
- copy /var/lib/sbctl to installed system /var/lib/sbctl (in future symlink it from /mnt/data/security)
- sbctl sign /efi/EFI/Linux/arch-linux.efi

### If TPM chain fails - regenerate the key

- `cryptsetup luksKillSlot /dev/<device> 2 # the id of the key for TPM`
  - or `systemd-cryptenroll --wipe-slot=tpm2 /drive`
- `systemd-cryptenroll /dev/<device> --wipe-slot=empty --tpm2-device=auto --tpm2-pcrs=7+15 # --tpm2-with-pin=yes`

### Include other encrypted volumes

Add entries to /etc/crypttab (data is name of device):

```
data UUID=1234...1234 none luks
backup UUID=1234...12 none luks
```

### (optional) install systemd-boot

We can load UKI efi directly, but we can use systemd-boot for a better menu for multibooting between OSs:

```
bootctl install
# and then sign the bootloader
```

### After installing windows x2

Both windows are installed into the same bootloader. Clone it, point to both from systemd-boot entries, load to each Windows and edit BCD using EasyBCD utility.

### Moved outside of the root FS (for backup)

- Flatpak user folder: ~/.var/app (includes Zen settings): /mnt/data/home/.var
- SbCtl keys: /var/lib/sbctl -> /mnt/data/security/sbctl

## OS setup
